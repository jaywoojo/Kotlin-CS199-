# Kotlin-CS199-

I want to continue my final project from CS125 last semester where I build a basic app, nothing fancy, that used the Metrapolitan Museum of Art's WebApi of thousands of paintings to build upon the concept of "learn about a new art piece a day" (stolen from read a book a week, etc.). It generates data about a piece if you select a genre, and I didn't get the chance to finish the portion where I was going to create a quiz.

There seem to be tons of interesting libraries, especially the Jetpack Compose that Harsh mentioned, and I'm keen on exploring how these libraries and Kotlin in general (instead of Java) can inhance the android experience.
